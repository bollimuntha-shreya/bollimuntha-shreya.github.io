<h3>About Me</h3>

I am a robotics researcher and an aspiring PhD candidate, currently in my final year of Dual Degree (B Tech and Master of Science in Electronics and Communication Engineering by Research) at IIIT Hyderabad. My research is centered on developing intelligent robotic systems that can learn complex manipulation tasks.
<br><br>
At the Robotics Research Centre (RRC), I have had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. K. Madhava Krishna (https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) and Prof. Nagamanikandan Govindan (https://nagamanigi.wixsite.com/home). My work is focused around dual arm manipulation, with publications accepted at major conferences like ICRA and IROS.
<br><br>
Beyond robotics, I have gained experience in software engineering as an intern at Stripe, where I developed an anomaly detection system, and have explored applied machine learning through various projects. I am driven by the goal of creating autonomous systems that can robustly perform meaningful tasks in the real world.

Outside the lab, I lead a balanced life filled with music and sports. I am a Grade 7 certified pianist from Trinity College of Music London and have competed in various inter-college music competitions. I'm also an active participant in sports, having won competitions in both basketball and swimming. I find that the discipline from music and the teamwork from sports complement my technical work in unexpected ways. When not immersed in research, playing piano, or on the court, I love traveling and exploring new places. Experiencing different cultures broadens my perspective and fuels my curiosity.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<span class="small_font">
My research interest lies in enabling robots to master complex, real-world manipulation tasks with the fluidity and adaptability of humans. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of reinforcement learning, control theory, and optimization. My goal is to develop algorithms that allow robots, especially in dual-arm settings, to learn efficiently by leveraging underlying physical and kinematic models. I believe the future of robotics hinges not just on collecting massive datasets, but on creating sample-efficient learning frameworks that can reason about contact, dynamics, and collaboration to solve tasks that are currently beyond their reach.

		We propose a personalized network to lipread an ALS patient using only one-shot examples. Our approach significantly improves and achieves high top-5accuracy with 83.2% accuracy compared to 62.6% achieved by comparable methods for the patient. Apart from evaluating our approach on the ALS patient, we also extend it to people with hearing impairment relying extensively on lip movements to communicate.
